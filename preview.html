		“We’ll find you a key role in the assault on Amakna. You’ll be my little cute pawn, Shiel” <br>
		Grace touched Shiel’s head with delicacy, then her hand wandered towards his check, 
		which she next took in her hand. Shiel’s cheeks turned slightly red as he could sense 
		Grace’s sight on his lips. He looked at hers as well, but he quickly remembered himself 
		and turned his head away. He had to admit to himself that Grace’s charm and her 
		hypnotizing eyes are hard to resist. However, he had vowed to himself to be loyal to 
		Chalsea and he’s not breaking that promise ever.
		“Are you trying to resist me?” <br>
		“I already have someone”<br>
		“Oh, pardon me. Who would that be, that lucky person?”<br>
		“That’s none of your interest” he responded thoughtlessly. <br>
		“Excuse me?” Grace painfully grabbed Shiel by his jaw “What was that?” <br>
		“I-... I apologize, I didn’t mean it” he looked frightened into Grace’s eyes. <br>
		“I didn’t expect such a lack of respect from you. A simple apology is not enough.”<br>
		From her hand quickly grew thorns that spiked Shiel’s face. He groaned from pain 
		and a few trickles of blood ran down his face.
		“Does that hurt?” she asked viciously.<br>
		“Y-yes… Your Grace. Please, let go…” he begged. <br>
