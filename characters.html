				Shiel is very cautious and thoughtful; always thinking before he acts, and his ways of thinking are logic and analytical. 
				He prefers to have and obey some rules, but he's capable of breaking them if he has a good reason to do so. 
				He has the ability to remain calm in tense situations. Even if something is giving him a trouble, he won't let anyone see it and keeps a poker face. 
				<p></br>
				Shiel is responsible and self-possessed most of the time, but his actions and wording might be aggressive sometimes. 
				He's often very quiet and reserved, and sometimes a little awkward when expressing his feelings (in a cute/charming way)
				Most would say he has a tough personality, is cold, aloof and restrained. However, he's a loving and caring person which can be seen when he's together with his family.
				He loves his parents a lot and respects them, willingly helps with home duties and loves to spend time with them. Home is also where he feels the happiest.

				<p></br>
				Grace is a strong willed and independent woman with ambitions. She won't let anyone stand in her way or let someone control her. 
				To many people, she appears to be intimidating and her power is hard to underestimate. She is generally respected. 
				<p></br>
				After long war between Brakmar and Amakna has finally ended, Grace decides to take matters into her own hands.
				With the help of her supporters, she managed to take over the crown and became a Governor of the Brakmar.
				Now she's working on bringing the nation back to life. 
				<p></br>
				Her aligment is chaotic evil. She does whatever her greed, hatred, or lust for destruction drive her to do. She likes to corrupt innocent and virtuous, and treats people like tools and manipulates them for his/her pleasure. She is violent, unfeeling, selfish, heartless. 
				<p></br>
				Grace is more into tactics and coming up with good strategies than into sex and stuff. A well-developed and armed nation with growing economy is her kink.
				Although she is asexual and aromantic, she knows how to flirt and uses her charm to toy with people.

				<p></br>
				Loren comes from a good amaknian family, where he was raised very well by his kind and understanding parents. He had a carefree childhood, in school he was liked a lot by others and had good grades. In highschool he began to work as an amaknian guard by his father's side, who was a Head Guard at that time. Years later his father went missing in unexplained circumstances and Loren was choosen to take over his father's rank. Now he serves his nation as a Head Guard and at the same time he's a Governor's assistant and bodyguard. 
				<p></br>
				Loren smiles a lot and most of the time he's optimistic, in a mood for jokes. 
				He's an outgoing person, loves to make new acquaintances and friends, doesn't mind talking to strangers or helping them as long as they don't seem suspicious.
				Loren wants everything to go his way, and thus often disagrees with others' opinions, decisions or ideas. 
				However he's not stubborn and often will put his ego aside and get his priorities straight, or will do his best to find a compromise in the end. 
			    He prefers easy solutions and avoids arguing. In a situation where he is ordered to do something he doesn't agree with, where there are no other options, he will rather do it than refuse and make a fuss about it. 
				He's got a big commitment to his work and is not afraid of taking responsibilities. He rather comes off as modest, but likes when people appreciate his work. Loren is also overly caring about his look and reputation.

			<div id="description">
				<p></br>
				A demigod, born thanks to the Osamodas God who helped the Amaknian King and Queen, who couldn't have a son who would take over the crown. 
				Both of his parents aren't alive anymore, and he's not a prince anymore, but a King. He has to deal with his grief while taking care of his nation.
				<p></br>
				Very patient and organized, authoritative, responsible, collected and cautious, living by a schedule.
				Altair can be often seen with a tender smile on his face. He's polite, kind-hearted, has good manners and knows how to behave. He's also a person you can depend on, ask for advice or for an honest opinion on something.
				He will always protect people that are close to him, but rather avoid fighting the threat if it's possible. However, he will not forget and forgive those who've hurt his friends.

				Chalsea has met Shiel at the Amaknian university. She was intrigued by his quiet personality and wanted to befriend him to see what's underneath it, knowing there must be something more about him. It took a while to gain his trust, but once they broke the ice, they fell for each other almost immediately. Shiel and Chalsea have bonded through being open and honest, having a lot of conversations and spending time together.
                Always listening and supporting each other. They are loyal and trust each other a lot.

				Abandoned by his parents when he was born, Marcus was raised by Riktus clan. 
				He is now the leader of a guild named Allies of the Shushu, where every member has their own Shushu weapon.

				He wants his guild to be made out of members who have tamed their shushus and can willingly transform with them through a shushu possession.
